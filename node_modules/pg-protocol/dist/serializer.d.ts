// It turns out that some (most?) JavaScript engines don't self-host
// `Array.prototype.sort`. This makes sense because C++ will likely remain
// faster than JS when doing raw CPU-intensive sorting. However, when using a
// custom comparator function, calling back and forth between the VM's C++ and
// JIT'd JS is rather slow *and* loses JIT type information, resulting in
// worse generated code for the comparator function than would be optimal. In
// fact, when sorting with a comparator, these costs outweigh the benefits of
// sorting in C++. By using our own JS-implemented Quick Sort (below), we get
// a ~3500ms mean speed-up in `bench/bench.html`.
